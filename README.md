# Structure IT test

### Notes:

I have created this in about 2-3hours and have not had any time to browser test this. So have only got this working for Chrome for now...

### Instructions:

- Write a responsive and accessible react app where a user can enter a Name, date of birth, telephone number with a combo box where a user can select their favourite pet type (cat, dog, snake).
- Heavy styling is not a requirement, but the app should work on both desktop and mobile and not look terrible.
- When adding a record, append to a grid where a person is a row in desktop and a card in mobile.
- No backend or persistent state required.

---

### To run the app:

##### 1. Import node modules

```
yarn
```

##### 2. Start the server

```
yarn start
```

##### 3. Navigate to http://localhost:3002
